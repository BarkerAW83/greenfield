## Notes about my group working style

* You will not find a more enthusiastic evangelist for programming. I love this stuff, and I love you for being here.
* Workflow is important.
* No one should feel alone or lost.
* We will become great friends.

## Candidate Schedule for Today

* Start by deciding an idea.
  * It is very important we're all on board with the idea.
  * Doesn't have to be a passion project for everyone, but we should all be excited to gain the experience.
* Decide BASIC tech stack.
  * Stress on basic, because we aren't married to anything on day 1 other than the idea.
* Create a project template together.
  * This allows everyone to get on the same page about technology choices and see the build / dev cycle.
* Create a task board.
  * Initially, this will likely be broad and imprecise.
  * Tasks will entail research and big changes to architecture involving very little code.
* Define roles and responsibilies; divide up tasks

## Idea(s)

* Volunteering Task Rabitt for good causes.
  * View jobs by location: Map
  * Partner account type
  * Partner View

* Okay, we're settled on this idea!
